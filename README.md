# AZAutoGrowingTextView

A sample project to demonstrate a Multiline Text input with AutoGrowing feature like Android in iOS platform. Here TextView will grow or shrink when you type according to your input or text content. Using UITextView within a UITableViewCell has also some issues when we need to input multiline text, this method also solves the problem. 

Requirements:
This requires iOS version 8.0 to higher. Before iOS 8.0, automatic height calculation of UITableViewCell was pretty hard to do.

Special Credits:
1. https://github.com/glaszig/SZTextView , It has been used to have placeholder in UITextView. But it's just an utility, UITextView or Any Subclass of UITextView should work fine.
2. https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager , It has been used to avoid any kind of manual keyboard handling.
